# Self-Balancing-two-wheel-Robot

The project core idea is to Balance a two wheel Robot using STM Micro Controller 

project  is implemented on STM Microcontroller using Cube IDE.

MPU 6050 inertial sensor and Stepper motors are used.

PID algorithm is implemented for balancing the Robot.
 
Language : C , IDE: CUBE , Microcontroller: STM F446RE
